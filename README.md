## 💬 Assessment Objective

> Conducted a complete cloud security assessment for an AWS-based system at a U.S. agency. I reviewed their IAM, encryption, logging, and network configurations against NIST 800-53 and other compliance frameworks. I delivered a redacted security report, roadmap, and checklist as part of the engagement. All work was done independently under a flexible contract.
